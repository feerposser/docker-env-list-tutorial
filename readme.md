# Docker compose .env file with flask
Simple tutorial for how to use environment variables with Docker and Flask.
## Why using .env files with Docker?
When we are developing an open source application that will run in some production environment, problably it will use some key or auth method for some service.
<br>
The open source code it will be exposed on our repo, and if we don't use different keys on dev environment and production environment, the security will be compromisse.
<br>
There is many ways to organize secret keys in production and development environments. One of then using Docker Compose is implementing an .env file and configure our docker-compose.yml for start to use the variables defined on this archieve.
